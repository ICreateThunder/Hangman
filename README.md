# Hangman

## Introduction

This is a tiny project which implements a the hangman game as a console application within C# utilsiing ascii art. The aim of the game is to guess what the program's chosen word is. On getting a correct letter guess the letter appears in its correct place within the word placeholder. If you guess incorrect the hangman animation (ascii art) updates and you have one less oppotunity to guess characters. The game ends with either the completed word or the hangman animation fully completing after 7 incorrect guesses.
